krefu - a small flashcard program

krefu is written in TCL; installation on OpenBSD 6.6 might look
something like

  doas pkg_add tcl-8.6.8p2 sqlite3-tcl-3.24.0

  # optional, for audio or images in cards (or use other commands
  # for this)
  doas pkg_add feh sox

  cp krefu /some/where/in/PATH
  cp krefu.1 /some/where/in/MANPATH/man1
  man krefu


the tests are written in Perl and require various Perl modules;

  make depend
  make test


krefu should be portable to systems that have unix terminals, stty(1),
TCL, and the TCL sqlite3 library. however portability has not been
tested beyond OpenBSD 6.6 and Mac OS X 10.11
