krefu - a small flashcard program

build and installation on OpenBSD 6.6 might look something like

  doas pkg_add tcl-8.6.8p2 sqlite3-tcl-3.24.0

  # optional, for audio or images in cards (or use other commands
  # for this)
  doas pkg_add feh sox

  make krefu
  cp krefu /some/where/in/PATH
  cp krefu.1 /some/where/in/MANPATH/man1
  man krefu

  mkdir -p ~/share/krefu
  cp main.tcl ~/share/krefu
  krefu init
  ...

the tests are written in Perl and require various Perl modules;

  make depend
  make test


krefu should be portable to systems that support unix terminals, curses,
TCL, and the TCL sqlite3 library. however portability has not been
tested beyond OpenBSD 6.6 and Mac OS X 10.11. BSD make and some flavor
of m4 may need to be found
